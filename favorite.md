### Favorite Text Editor

- I enjoy VI/ VIM the most so far when it comes to text editors. Honestly I have never met someone at my work that uses anyhting else besides VI/ VIM , and I think that is the main reason why that has just become the norm for me. Yes you need to look up some commands unlike nano and emacs that have the super easy in your face help sections. But, I think that also destracts the user from everthing that they are trying to accomplish. I want to just be able to go in a edit my file, and that is what VI does for you. 

- I love using `:set number` , for getting my lines of the file easily set.
- Find and Replace globaly for your file is easy in VI `:%s/pattern/replaceWithPattern/g`

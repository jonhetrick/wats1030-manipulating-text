### Favorite Text Editor

- I enjoy VI/ VIM the most so far when it comes to text editors. Honestly I have never met someone at my work that uses anyhting else besides VI/ VIM , and I think that is the main reason why that has just become the norm for me. Yes you need to look up some commands unlike nano and emacs that have the super easy in your face help sections. Nano by far is the worst editor, I hate the control + whatever key, then some is alt + another key.I think that the extra nonsense nano and emacs shows you, destracts the user from everthing that they are trying to accomplish. I want to just be able to go in and edit my file, and that is what VI/VIM does for you. 


__Favorite VIM commands:__
- I love using `:set number` , for getting my lines of the file easily set.
- Find and Replace globaly for your file is easy in VI `:%s/pattern/replaceWithPattern/g`
- Also, using Find and count the number of patterns `:%s/pattern//gc`
